- Habboo zainyh
- Slezak jslez, Swayable
- Weitzman PinkyWeitzman, ACLU - Not partisan ie we’ve sued every president, Quadrupled our membership, 4M followers
- Dawn LauraDawnANW - Art Not war, Humanity for HIllary, 375M people in 3 mons, One of 60 targets of well choriopgraphed attack from conservative movment

1. Wide range of impact is possible
2. Impact can be negative
3. You can make allies in unexpected places
4. `Found` can be as good as `made`

**Slezak showed two videos on DACA** What's more pursassive? I (and most people here) got it wrong. Rural moved the most. see 3 above.

Weitzman - ACLU

Data, advocacy, story telling

Doesn't have access to the same trove of user data, ie 3p cookies, is not something ACLU is down with as it doesn't align with their data privacy advocacy.

### Dawn - The Machine They've Built

Need to examine what Conservative movement built to understand.
Multiple sustained exposure to message
Volume of exposure
R has bigger army.
Those messages reinforced in echo chambers and are scary effective when message break outs

**They brought Uzis, and we have a ham sandwich.** Left says “that is not true”. It gets published by specific mainstream actors. Message reaches ausidence w/ fewer channels. We can’t have 6 month studies, we need immedate data testing. We’re losing war of ideas, because we are working in targeted campaigns vs. building structure (their own reality)

**“Facts alone don’t change ppls minds, facts backs up the message.”**

**“If you have an important story to tell, it's your obligation to tell it effectively.”**

Data is useful to listen at scale. Doesn’t have to be slimey tracking cookies, trick people into handing over data w/o their full understanding.

Black 4.3X times more likely to be arrested for mj possession. Good story, and a fact. Example of playing the fact card (effectively?)

**Facts !== persuasion** Facts don’t matter. What matters is who gets their first. Lead narrative → Lead audience. Our brains are wired to believe. Organize around a common belief is greatest strength.

**Social engagement metrics**

What can be learned from like:comment ratio. One way to look at it is we’ve addressed concerns if ratio is higher (eg Low likes:comments → discussion, debate, or people upset)

What do we need to do? a) Reach more vs. b) persuading more people. Look at comments.

**Current State of Social Engagement Platforms**

Help you steer car but don’t tell you if you got home.

Move-needle metrics → ask or watch behavior, social listening

*Engagement vs. persuasion*

It's as if this space is in this local maximum, sophisticated ways to measure engagement, click, sign, donate, etc., but that can’t tell you how to win bigger majorities.

*High-value data vs. big data.*

**Long-term, Long tale issues.**

What do we do to think beyond an election cycle?

Weitzman: We need to fire people up to fight for core constitutional issues regardless of whitehouse. What’s will work now, will not work w/ 8 years from now. Consider the multi-decade fight for marriage equality.

For long-term, long-tale, the key is to evolve, meet people where they are.

**5 pcs of what the weapon the R-wing built**

1. Created massive social influence network, 100ks real and fake. Of various sizes for various uses. 
2. Digital website network, 100 sites, SEO, link, content sharing from mainstream, massive content, performance testing, emo/visceral content, large scale social engineering, $100M-$1B+ investment.

We need a come to Jesus moment when it comes.

We need to people on other side (this means DC in this contenxt) to understand the playing. DC doesn’t understand totality, Left hasn't built long-term infrastructure.

**The fight doesn’t have to be symmetric.** We don’t need to be unethical. Truth & facts are not handicaps. We don’t need bots and trolls. Organic ain't bad at all. eg FB.com/Being Liberal, 15M/wk, doesn’t take a dime.

We have power to create something just as powerful.

**How deeply do you have to affect someone?**

Breakdown barrier between persuasion vs mobilization/advocacy/outcomes. Persuasion needs to happen all the time (inside as it relates to continued progress and outside of course).

Example: #ReleaseTheMemo In one day, from 4PM - midnight 0-600k uses; had a legislative outcome; Works because you’ve built the platform.

We often don’t have time to lay the groundwork. <-- you know all about this!

**Reasons to be deeply optimistic**

Americans are generally very rational. We have ton of agreement. eg gun control, the problem is it's not being refelected by our elected officials.

**H campaign could have done what Trump campaigned did.**

"I'm in awe of what they build. I'm afraid of it, but I'm in awe." Fake news, gaming SEO, they are killing it when Youtube rapid response. I don't think we're prepared for it in this mid-term cycle. Lots of cooredination on R's side that's admirable.

We don't have to fight dirty to win. We can't be afriad to go very broad with targeted content.

**People want to buy the crazy story of about the aliens**

NYT born out of response to Yellow Press / tabloid headlines

w/ concentration of power, need to hold content providers accountable; however, a "Zuck, fix this problem!" ain't gonna work.

"We should use more alien" <-- ha

R used audience segmentation to GSD. That's not a bad thing. It's a way to understand your audience.

**Progressive movement - be mindful of smugness**

My family is living in a world where Trump is stimulating economy, he's addressing immigration in ways Obama couldn't.

Who's world is correct? We each believe our own is. Is there objective truth, we both think there is.

**Gotta admire the R** Lots of cooredination on R's side that's admirable.

Left has enjoyed a cultural advantage. World of arts, storytelling, etc. <-- I see this but missed what the takeaway was.

**What does Koch get when they win?** coal mines, sucking wealth out of all of us, out of the environment to them.

**What does Soros gets?** To sleep a little better at the end of the night. He probably loses a little bit of money.
